# API service for crewai

Follow the ./api/API_SCHEMA.md file to scaffold a new FastAPI application into the ./api folder. This API will be the frontend application interface into CrewAI. Ensure that the entire deployment can be run from a docker container and includes a top level docker-compose.yml file to fully bring up the front and backend apps together.
